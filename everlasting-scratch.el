;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides a global minor mode `everlasting-scratch-mode'
;; that causes the scratch buffer to respawn after it's killed and with
;; its content restored.
;;
;; @note: borrowed lots of stuff from immortal-scratch, thanks mate.

;;; Usage:
;;
;;  (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'everlasting-scratch-mode)

;;; Code:

(require 'desktop)
